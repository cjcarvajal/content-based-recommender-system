# Content Based Recommender System

## What it does?

A content recommender system, in contrast to a collaborative filtering system, depends on the content of the items (as you might guess) instead of the ratings given by other users to the same items. One question rises and is how the system knows the content of an item? There is no magic here, the system needs metadata about the items to know their content, so each time a new item enters the system it needs to have this metadata in order to by recommended. For this demo, the items are movies, and the content is described by **keywords** that describe the content, for example an item like Jurassic Park has "dinosaur" as a keyword on its metadata. The system, compares the metadata of all items and returns the more similar items.

A content recommender system may be as broad as it's needed, for example, in the movie context, one could add the actors, director or soundtrack composer (please be Ennio Morricone or Hans Zimmer) as metadata.

Lets see some example of the system running:
